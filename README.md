Hi there 👋

My current side-project is "Librarian", an app to find a book in your personnel librairie (scan with your mobile) when you go shopping.

📌 Last Website Project : Décoration-360 , a webside for an interior architect.
💻 Stack : WordPress, GitHub.
📌 Last Application : High riders, as Symfony Developer, and little development React.
💻 Stack : Symfony, Api REST using Doctrine, 

🌱 I’m currently learning Symfony and WordPress to be self-sufficient and growing up in society
